# Sales Dashboard

This interactive Power BI dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of sales data from a sample superstore dataset. Before building the dashboard, I performed essential data preprocessing steps, including:
Changing data types (e.g., converting columns to Whole Number, Decimal Number, and Date formats) Ensuring consistent and clean data structure for accurate visualizations

üîç Key Insights:

Sales by Category & Region:
Technology has the highest overall sales, followed by Furniture and Office Supplies.
The West and East regions show strong performance across all categories, especially in Technology.

Discount Impact on Profit:
The bubble chart shows a clear trend: higher discounts don't always translate to higher profits.
Several products are incurring losses at higher discounts, indicating the need to reassess discount strategies.

Sales Trend Over Time:
Sales have shown a consistent upward trend across all four quarters.
Q4 shows the highest sales spike, possibly due to seasonal or holiday factors.

Ship Mode Analysis:
Standard Class is the most frequently used shipping method (61.13%), followed by Second Class and First Class.
Same Day delivery, although convenient, is the least used‚Äîpossibly due to higher costs or availability issues.
